1. e4 {The most popular, active, and \"romantic\" first move.} 1... e5 {Just as
good as White's first move.} 2. Nf3 {Developing \"with tempo\" and attacking
e5.} 2... Nc6 {Developing and defending e5.} 3. Bc4 {Developing the bishop to a
central diagonal and attacking f7 - the weakest square, defended only by the
king.} 3... Bc5 {Also developing the bishop to a great diagonal.} 4. b4 $5
{[%c_effect b4;square;b4;type;Interesting;persistent;true] The \"Evan's Gambit\"
- all the rage in 1852 $1 This move sacrifices a pawn to expand in the center (c3
+ d4) with a gain of time and to gain active lines and diagonals for the white
pieces.} 4... Bxb4 {[%c_highlight
d8;keyPressed;none;opacity;0.8;square;d8;persistent;false] When facing a gambit,
you should usually accept it. Otherwise you are forced back without gaining
material.} 5. c3 {Threatening the b4-bishop and intending d4.} 5... Ba5
{Retreating and staying pointed at the king on e1.} 6. d4 {Building (at least
temporarily) the perfect pawn center: e4 and d4.} 6... exd4 {Eliminating White's
perfect pawn center.} (6... d6 {Keeping the strong point on e5 is considered
more solid today.}) 7. O-O {Castling and also unpinning the c-pawn so as to
capture on d4 next move.} 7... d3 $2 {[%c_effect
d3;square;d3;type;Mistake;persistent;true] This gives back the pawn to prevent
White from capturing on d4, but it has the same downside as 7...dxc3. It loses
time that could be used to develop and castle.} (7... dxc3 $6 {[%c_effect
c3;square;c3;type;Inaccuracy;persistent;true] This was played in the famous game
Fischer vs. Fine. Capturing more pawns without developing is too \"greedy.\"} 8.
Qb3 Qe7 9. Nxc3 Nf6 10. Nd5 Nxd5 11. exd5 {The e-file is now open to Black's
king. That allowed Fischer to win swiftly.}) 8. Qb3 {Developing the queen and
attacking f7.} 8... Qf6 {Developing the queen and defending f7 :D} 9. e5
{Expanding in the middle and gaining time by threatening the black queen.} 9...
Qg6 {Retreating the queen and defending d3.} (9... Nxe5 $2 {[%c_effect
e5;square;e5;type;Mistake;persistent;true]} 10. Re1 d6 11. Qb5+ {attacks the
king and the bishop on a5, winning the bishop.}) 10. Re1 $6 {[%c_effect
e1;square;e1;type;Inaccuracy;persistent;true] The rook is developed, but the
e-file is blocked by a pawn. Rd1 makes more sense.} 10... Nge7 {Developing and
getting ready to castle $1} 11. Ba3 {The bishop is placed on a nice diagonal,
attacking e7.} 11... b5 $2 {[%c_effect b5;square;b5;type;Mistake;persistent;true]
Black sacrifices a pawn to open the b-file for his rook and b7 for his bishop,
but this makes little sense. Neither should become active enough to justify
this.} (11... O-O {Black is fine after this.}) 12. Qxb5 {Capturing the free
pawn.} 12... Rb8 {Attacking the queen and seizing the open (but not very
valuable) b-file.} 13. Qa4 {Stepping back and keeping a5 under attack.} 13...
Bb6 {Saving the bishop and responding to the threat of capture on e7 when the
knight on c6 cannot capture back AND defend a5.} (13... O-O $4 {[%c_effect
g8;square;g8;type;Blunder;persistent;true] The knight on c6 is overworked so
White can win a piece.} 14. Bxe7 Nxe7 15. Qxa5 $18) 14. Nbd2 {Developing the
final minor piece.} 14... Bb7 $2 {[%c_effect
b7;square;b7;type;Mistake;persistent;true] The bishop is placed on a GREAT
diagonal. However, castling is much more important.} (14... O-O {This is the
last good chance.}) 15. Ne4 $1 {[%c_effect
e4;square;e4;type;GreatFind;persistent;true] The knight advances to a great
square and blocks the black queen so as to play Bxd3 next turn.} 15... Qf5 $4
{[%c_effect f5;square;f5;type;Blunder;persistent;true] This move is totally
pointless. Why is the queen better on f5 than g6 $2 Black should now be crushed.}
(15... O-O 16. Bxd3 {Threatens Nf6+ that would win the black queen.}) 16. Bxd3
{Grabbing the pawn and pointing at the black queen with a threat of Nf6+ $1} 16...
Qh5 {The queen must now retreat from the threat of discovered checks that wins
the lady.} (16... O-O $2 {[%c_effect g8;square;g8;type;Mistake;persistent;true]
too late :(} 17. Nf6+ gxf6 18. Bxf5 {wins the queen.}) 17. Nf6+ $6 {[%c_effect
f6;square;f6;type;Inaccuracy;persistent;true] This is a bit too eager, BUT the
idea to sacrifice a piece to open the e-file makes great sense. The problem is
that White allows the g-file pointing to his king to be opened, and there isn't
a forced win for him.} (17. Ng3 {Chasing the queen will soon win the lady or
craft a powerful attack.} 17... Qh6 18. Rad1 O-O 19. Bc1 Qe6 20. Ng5 {Attacks
the h7-pawn and the queen and wins comfortably.}) 17... gxf6 {The queen is also
under attack so declining the knight is not possible.} 18. exf6 {Recapturing.}
18... Rg8 $1 {[%c_effect g8;square;g8;type;GreatFind;persistent;true] Grabbing the
open g-file. For the first time this game, White's king feels pressure too.} 19.
Rad1 $3 {[%c_effect d1;square;d1;type;Brilliant;persistent;true] A brilliant move
which anticipates the coming sacrifices on e7 and d7. I LOVE that White saw and
took the chance to include his final piece in the attack. Leave no piece
behind.} (19. fxe7 $4 {[%c_effect e7;square;e7;type;Blunder;persistent;true] This
just makes the black king very safe behind the pawn.} 19... Qxf3 {The g-pawn is
pinned.} 20. g3 Qxf2+ 21. Kh1 Qf3#) 19... Qxf3 $2 {[%c_effect
f3;square;f3;type;Mistake;persistent;true]} (19... Qh3 $1 {[%c_effect
h3;square;h3;type;GreatFind;persistent;true] This is a computer-perfect
defense.} 20. Bf1 {Defending mate on g2.} (20. g3 Rxg3+ $1 {[%c_effect
g3;square;g3;type;GreatFind;persistent;true]} 21. hxg3 Qxg3+ 22. Kh1 Qxf3+ 23.
Kh2 Bxf2 $19) 20... Qf5 $1 {[%c_effect f5;square;f5;type;GreatFind;persistent;true]
This move (not capturing the knight on f3 because of Rxe7+ $1) intends to capture
on f6 and saves the game for Black. Incredible.}) 20. Rxe7+ $1 {[%c_effect
e7;square;e7;type;GreatFind;persistent;true] Brilliant $1 Anderssen has seen the
coming checkmate.} 20... Nxe7 {Capturing the rook and *probably* not seeing the
next move.} (20... Kd8 21. Rxd7+ $1 {[%c_effect
d7;square;d7;type;GreatFind;persistent;true] Exposing the black king fully.}
21... Kc8 22. Rd8+ $3 {[%c_effect d8;square;d8;type;Brilliant;persistent;true]}
22... Kxd8 (22... Rxd8 23. gxf3 $18) 23. Bf5+ Qxd1+ 24. Qxd1+ $18) 21. Qxd7+ $3
{[%c_effect d7;square;d7;type;Brilliant;persistent;true] Another brilliant move $1
White's queen sacrifice drags Black's king into a double check that forces
checkmate.} 21... Kxd7 {Asking to be shown the checkmate.} (21... Kf8 22. Bxe7#)
22. Bf5+ $1 {[%c_effect f5;square;f5;type;GreatFind;persistent;true] The correct
double check.} (22. Bb5+ $4 {[%c_effect
b5;square;b5;type;Blunder;persistent;true] This lets black's king get away.}
22... Ke6 23. Bd7+ Kxf6 $19) 22... Ke8 {Trying to hide in the center.} (22... Kc6
23. Bd7# {This is my favorite checkmate in the game.}) 23. Bd7+ {Pushing the
king to a fatal square.} 23... Kf8 {Running to d8 is the same.} (23... Kd8 24.
Bxe7# (24. fxe7#)) 24. Bxe7# {A beautiful finish to a fantastic game. This game
is well-named and is sure to always seem fresh and inspiring to chess
audiences.} 1-0
