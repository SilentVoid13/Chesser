A chess game viewer/editor for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

## Demonstration

## Usage

To use [Chesser](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Chesser), you first need to declare a `chess` code block like so:

![chesser_block](imgs/chesser_block.png)

This will create a basic chess board in the start position.

You can declare various settings **inside** the `chess` code block, like a [FEN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation) string to describe a particular board position. You can find the full settings list below.

## Settings

Here are the available settings for a `chesr` code block:

| Name          | Possible Values                                              | Description                                                  |

| `orientation` | `white`/`black`                                              | Orientation of the board.                                    |
